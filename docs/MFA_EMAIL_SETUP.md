# MFA Email Setup with AWS SES

This document explains how to set up AWS SES (Simple Email Service) for sending MFA tokens via email.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account
2. Verified email domain or email address in AWS SES
3. SMTP credentials for AWS SES

## AWS SES Setup

### 1. Verify Your Email Domain/Address

1. Go to the [AWS SES Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/)
2. Navigate to "Verified identities"
3. Click "Create identity"
4. Choose either:
   - **Domain**: If you own a domain (recommended for production)
   - **Email address**: For testing purposes
5. Follow the verification process

### 2. Create SMTP Credentials

1. In the AWS SES console, go to "SMTP settings"
2. Click "Create SMTP credentials"
3. Enter a username (or use the auto-generated one)
4. Click "Create"
5. **Important**: Download and save the credentials securely

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# AWS SES Configuration for Email
AWS_SES_SMTP_USERNAME=your_aws_ses_smtp_username
AWS_SES_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_aws_ses_smtp_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com  # Must be verified in SES
```

### 4. Update AWS SES Region (if needed)

The default region in the code is `us-east-1`. If your SES is in a different region, update the host in `mfaController.ts`:

```typescript
host: 'email-smtp.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com',
```

Common SES endpoints:
- US East (N. Virginia): `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- US West (Oregon): `email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
- Europe (Ireland): `email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`

## Testing

### Development/Sandbox Mode

By default, AWS SES operates in sandbox mode, which means:
- You can only send emails to verified email addresses
- You have a daily sending limit of 200 emails
- You can send up to 1 email per second

### Production Mode

To send emails to any recipient:
1. Request production access in the AWS SES console
2. Go to "Sending statistics" â†’ "Request production access"
3. Fill out the form explaining your use case
4. Wait for AWS approval (usually 24-48 hours)

## Email Template

The MFA email includes:
- Professional HTML formatting
- Clear token display
- 5-minute expiration notice
- Security warning
- Plain text fallback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Email address not verified"**
   - Ensure the `FROM_EMAIL` is verified in AWS SES
   - Check that the email address exactly matches the verified identity

2. **"Message rejected"**
   - Verify you're not in sandbox mode or the recipient email is verified
   - Check your SES sending statistics for bounces/complaints

3. **"Invalid credentials"**
   - Verify your SMTP username and password
   - Ensure you're using SMTP credentials, not AWS access keys

4. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Check the SES endpoint region
   - Verify firewall/security group settings

### Testing Email Delivery

You can test the MFA email endpoint with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mfa/emailToken \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit SES credentials to version control
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent email abuse
3. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire in 5 minutes for security
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect tokens in transit
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor SES bounce and complaint rates to maintain reputation

## Cost

AWS SES pricing (as of 2024):
- First 62,000 emails per month: $0 (free tier)
- Additional emails: $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- No setup fees or monthly charges

## Alternative Email Providers

If you prefer other email services, you can modify the nodemailer configuration for:
- Gmail SMTP
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Postmark

Just update the transporter configuration in `emailMfaToken` function.
